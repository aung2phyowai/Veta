# Veta: a MATLAB-based toolbox that provides simultaneous EMG data collection and visualization as well as streamlined offline processing that is designed specifically for use with TMS.

## Workflow

### Main Functions
	
#### recordEMG- visualizes and collects EMG data
		helper functions:
		setOffset-calculates electrode voltage offset for each channel
		EMGfigure-creates and refreshes figure for data visualization
		addchannels-adds user-specified number of EMG channels 
		pulldata- extracts data every sweep
#### findEMG - identifies MEP and EMG burst events
#### visualizeEMG - GUI that visualizes data with found events

Data can be collected with **recordEMG** or generated by other data acquistion software. **Conversion Tools** can be used in the latter case. **findEMG** identifies MEP and EMG burst events. Interactive data review is performed with **visualizeEMG**, which uniquely allows the user to manually correct misidentified events.
